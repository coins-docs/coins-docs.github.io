# Public Rest API for Coins (2022-09-12)

## General API Information

* The base endpoint is: **https://api.qa.coinsxyz.me** (sandbox)
* All endpoints return either a JSON object or array.
* Data is returned in **ascending** order. Oldest first, newest last.
* All time and timestamp related fields are in milliseconds.

## HTTP Return Codes
* HTTP `4XX` return codes are used for for malformed requests;the issue is on the sender's side.
* HTTP `403` return code is used when the WAF Limit (Web Application Firewall) has been violated.
* HTTP `429` return code is used when breaking a request rate limit.
* HTTP `418` return code is used when an IP has been auto-banned for continuing to send requests after receiving `429` codes.
* HTTP `5XX` return codes are used for internal errors; the issue is on exchange's side.It is important to **NOT** treat this as a failure operation; the execution status is UNKNOWN and could have been a success.

## Error Codes
* Any endpoint can return an ERROR; the error payload is as follows:

```javascript
{
  "code": -1121,
  "msg": "Invalid symbol."
}
```

* Specific error codes and messages defined in another document.

## API Library

### Connectors

The following are lightweight libraries that work as connectors to the Coins public API, written in different languages:

* Python https://github.com/coins-docs/coins-connector-python

### Postman Collections


Postman collections are available, and they are recommended for new users seeking a quick and easy start with the API.

https://github.com/coins-docs/coins-api-postman

## General Information on Endpoints

* For `GET` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.
* For `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` endpoints, the parameters may be sent as a
  `query string` or in the `request body` with content type
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. You may mix parameters between both the
  `query string` and `request body` if you wish to do so.
* Parameters may be sent in any order.
* If a parameter sent in both the `query string` and `request body`, the
  `query string` parameter will be used.



### LIMITS

**General Info on Limits**

* intervalNum describes the amount of the interval. For example, intervalNum 5 with intervalLetter M means "Every 5 minutes".

* A 429 will be returned when either rate limit is violated.



### IP Limits

* Each route has a `weight` which determines for the number of requests each endpoint counts for. Heavier endpoints and endpoints that do operations on multiple symbols will have a heavier `weight`.
* When a 429 is recieved, it's your obligation as an API to back off and not spam the API.
* **Repeatedly violating rate limits and/or failing to back off after receiving 429s will result in an automated IP ban (http status 418).**
* IP bans are tracked and **scale in duration** for repeat offenders, **from 2 minutes to 3 days**.
* A `Retry-After` header is sent with a 418 or 429 responses and will give the **number of seconds**required to wait, in the case of a 429, to prevent a ban, or, in the case of a 418, until the ban is over.
* **The limits on the API are based on the IPs, not the API keys.**



### Order Rate Limits

- When the order count exceeds the limit, you will receive a 429 error without the `Retry-After` header.

- The order rate limit is counted against each IP and UID.



### Websocket Limits

- A single connection can listen to a maximum of 1024 streams.



### /api/ Limit Introduction

- Endpoints related to `/api/*`:

  - According to the two modes of IP and UID limit, each are independent.

  - Endpoints share the 1200 per minute limit based on IP.



### Endpoint security type

* Each endpoint has a security type that determines the how you will interact with it.This is stated next to the NAME of the endpoint.
  - If no security type is stated, assume the security type is NONE.
* API-keys are passed into the Rest API via the `X-COINS-APIKEY`header.
* API-keys and secret-keys **are case sensitive**.
* API-keys can be configured to only access certain types of secure endpoints.
  For example, one API-key could be used for TRADE only, while another API-key can access everything except for TRADE routes.
* By default, API-keys can access all secure routes.

Security Type | Description
------------ | ------------
NONE | Endpoint can be accessed freely.
TRADE | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key and signature.
USER_STREAM | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.
MARKET_DATA | Endpoint requires sending a valid API-Key.

* `TRADE` and `USER_DATA` endpoints are `SIGNED` endpoints.



### SIGNED (TRADE and USER_DATA) Endpoint security

* `SIGNED` endpoints require an additional parameter, `signature`, to be
  sent in the  `query string` or `request body`.
* Endpoints use `HMAC SHA256` signatures. The `HMAC SHA256 signature` is a keyed `HMAC SHA256` operation.
  Use your `secretKey` as the key and `totalParams` as the value for the HMAC operation.
* The `signature` is **not case sensitive**.
* `totalParams` is defined as the `query string` concatenated with the
  `request body`.



### Timing security

* A `SIGNED` endpoint also requires a parameter, `timestamp`, to be sent which
  should be the millisecond timestamp of when the request was created and sent.
* An additional parameter, `recvWindow`, may be sent to specify the number of
  milliseconds after `timestamp` the request is valid for. If `recvWindow`
  is not sent, **it defaults to 5000**.
* Currently, `recvWindow` is only used when creates order.
* The logic is as follows:

  ```javascript
  if (timestamp < (serverTime + 1000) && (serverTime - timestamp) <= recvWindow) {
    // process request
  } else {
    // reject request
  }
  ```

**Serious trading is about timing.** Networks can be unstable and unreliable,
which can lead to requests taking varying amounts of time to reach the
servers. With `recvWindow`, you can specify that the request must be
processed within a certain number of milliseconds or be rejected by the
server.

**It recommended to use a small recvWindow of 5000 or less!The max cannot go beyond 60,000!**



### SIGNED Endpoint Examples for POST /openapi/v1/order

Here is a step-by-step example of how to send a valid signed payload from the
Linux command line using `echo`, `openssl`, and `curl`.

Key | Value

```

Note that the signature is different in example 3.
There is no & between "GTC" and "quantity=1".



## Public API Endpoints

### Terminology

These terms will be used throughout the documentation, so it is recommended especially for new users to read to help their understanding of the API.

* `base asset` refers to the asset that is the `quantity` of a symbol. For the symbol BTCUSDT, BTC would be the `base asset`.
* `quote asset` refers to the asset that is the `price` of a symbol. For the symbol BTCUSDT, USDT would be the `quote asset`.



### ENUM definitions

**Symbol status:**

* TRADING
* BREAK (ongoing)
* CANCEL_ONLY (ongoing)

**Order status:**

Status | Description

### Filters

Filters define trading rules on a symbol or an exchange. Filters come in two forms: `symbol filters` and `exchange filters`.



#### Symbol filters

##### PRICE_FILTER

The `PRICE_FILTER` defines the `price` rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minPrice` defines the minimum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed.
* `maxPrice` defines the maximum `price`/`stopPrice` allowed.
* `tickSize` defines the intervals that a `price`/`stopPrice` can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `price filter`, the following must be true for `price`/`stopPrice`:

* `price` >= `minPrice`
* `price` <= `maxPrice`
* (`price`-`minPrice`) % `tickSize` == 0

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PRICE_FILTER",
    "minPrice": "0.00000100",
    "maxPrice": "100000.00000000",
    "tickSize": "0.00000100"
  }
```



##### PERCENT_PRICE

The `PERCENT_PRICE` filter defines valid range for a price based on the weighted average of the previous trades. `avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the weighted average price is calculated over.

In order to pass the `percent price`, the following must be true for `price`:

- `price` <= `weightedAveragePrice` * `multiplierUp`
- `price` >= `weightedAveragePrice` * `multiplierDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE",
    "multiplierUp": "1.3000",
    "multiplierDown": "0.7000",
    "avgPriceMins": 5
  }
```



##### PERCENT_PRICE_SA

The `PERCENT_PRICE_SA` filter defines valid range for a price based on the  simple average of the previous trades. `avgPriceMins` is the number of minutes the simple average price is calculated over.

In order to pass the `percent_price_sa`, the following must be true for `price`:

- `price` <= `simpleAveragePrice` * `multiplierUp`
- `price` >= `simpleAveragePrice` * `multiplierDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE_SA",
    "multiplierUp": "1.3000",
    "multiplierDown": "0.7000",
    "avgPriceMins": 5
  }
```



##### PERCENT_PRICE_BY_SIDE

The `PERCENT_PRICE_BY_SIDE` filter defines the valid range for the price based on the last price of the symbol.
There is a different range depending on whether the order is placed on the `BUY` side or the `SELL` side.

Buy orders will succeed on this filter if:

- `Order price` <= `bidMultiplierUp` * `lastPrice`
- `Order price` >= `bidMultiplierDown` * `lastPrice`

Sell orders will succeed on this filter if:

- `Order Price` <= `askMultiplierUp` * `lastPrice`
- `Order Price` >= `askMultiplierDown` * `lastPrice`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE_BY_SIDE",
    "bidMultiplierUp": "1.2",
    "bidMultiplierDown": "0.2",
    "askMultiplierUp": "1.5",
    "askMultiplierDown": "0.8",
  }
```



##### PERCENT_PRICE_INDEX

The `PERCENT_PRICE_INDEX` filter defines valid range for a price based on the  index price which is calculated based on  several exhanges in the market by centain rule. (indexPrice wobsocket pushing will be available in future)

In order to pass the `percent_price_index`, the following must be true for `price`:

- `price` <= `indexPrice` * `multiplierUp`
- `price` >= `indexPrice` * `multiplierDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE_INDEX",
    "multiplierUp": "1.3000",
    "multiplierDown": "0.7000",
  }
```



##### PERCENT_PRICE_ORDER_SIZE

The `PERCENT_PRICE_ORDER_SIZE` filter  is used to determine whether the execution of an order would cause the market price to fluctuate beyond the limit price, and if so, the order will be rejected.

In order to pass the `percent_price_order_size`, the following must be true:

- A buy order needs to meet: the market price after the order get filled  <`askPrice` * `multiplierUp`
- A sell order needs to meet: the market price after the order get filled  >`bidPrice` * `multiplierDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "PERCENT_PRICE_ORDER_SIZE",
    "multiplierUp": "1.3000",
    "multiplierDown": "0.7000"
  }
```



##### STATIC_PRICE_RANGE

The `STATIC_PRICE_RANGE` filter defines a static valid range for the price.

In order to pass the `static_price_range`, the following must be true for `price`:

- `price` <= `priceUp`
- `price` >= `priceDown`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "STATIC_PRICE_RANGE",
    "priceUp": "520",
    "priceDown": "160"
  }
```



##### LOT_SIZE

The `LOT_SIZE` filter defines the `quantity` (aka "lots" in auction terms) rules for a symbol. There are 3 parts:

* `minQty` defines the minimum `quantity` allowed.
* `maxQty` defines the maximum `quantity` allowed.
* `stepSize` defines the intervals that a `quantity`can be increased/decreased by.

In order to pass the `lot size`, the following must be true for `quantity`:

* `quantity` >= `minQty`
* `quantity` <= `maxQty`
* (`quantity`-`minQty`) % `stepSize` == 0

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "LOT_SIZE",
    "minQty": "0.00100000",
    "maxQty": "99999999.00000000",
    "stepSize": "0.00100000"
  }
```



##### NOTIONAL

The `NOTIONAL` filter defines the acceptable notional range allowed for an order on a symbol.

In order to pass this filter, the notional (`price * quantity`) has to pass the following conditions:

- `price * quantity` <= `maxNotional`
- `price * quantity` >= `minNotional`

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
{
   "filterType": "NOTIONAL",
   "minNotional": "10.00000000",
   "maxNotional": "10000.00000000"
}
```



##### MAX_NUM_ORDERS

The `MAX_NUM_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
Note that both triggered "algo" orders and normal orders are counted for this filter.

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ORDERS",
    "maxNumOrders": 200
  }
```



##### MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS

The `MAX_ALGO_ORDERS` filter defines the maximum number of untriggered "algo" orders an account is allowed to have open on a symbol.
"Algo" orders are `STOP_LOSS`, `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT`, `TAKE_PROFIT`, and `TAKE_PROFIT_LIMIT` orders.

**/exchangeInfo format:**

```javascript
  {
    "filterType": "MAX_NUM_ALGO_ORDERS",
    "maxNumAlgoOrders": 5
  }
```
