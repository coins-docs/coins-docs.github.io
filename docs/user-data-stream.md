* Doing a `PUT` on a `listenKey` will extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* Doing a `DELETE` on a `listenKey` will close the stream and invalidate the listenKey.
* Doing a `POST` on an account with an active `listenKey` will return the currently active `listenKey` and extend its validity for 60 minutes.
* The base websocket endpoint is: **wss://wsapi.pro.coins.ph**
